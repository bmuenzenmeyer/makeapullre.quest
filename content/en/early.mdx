title: Make a pull request early

> Progress over perfection.

From [the first pull request](https://github.com/bmuenzenmeyer/makeapullre.quest/pull/2)

this isn't perfect - but nothing really is.

Opening a PR frames my perspective in act of adding to the production codebase. It lets me see the changeset as a reviewer would. I can choose to spend as much time as I like in this state, making the pull request as understandable and actionable for reviewers as possible.

Opening a PR early lets me see the changeset take shape, commit by commit. Did I miss something? I don't often fret long commit histories, because in my experience people don't often review commit by commit. The PR body is the public forum.

we'll be diving deep over time - but this is the first step!
